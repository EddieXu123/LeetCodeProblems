            The idea is very simple here. We need to get one of the region and its ancestors in a set and then check if region2 or its any of the 
            parent or ancestor is present in the set. If we find a match then that is the smallest common region between region1 and region2.
            Follwing are the steps:
            1. Get the map of child-parent, Key = child, Value = parent
                This will make our life easier as iterating a map is easy than a bunch of lists
            2. We have to keep adding region1, its parent, grandparent, etc. in a set till it doesn't become null
            3. Now keep checking for region2 or its parents/ancestors in a set
            4. Wherever we find a match, that is our answer!
